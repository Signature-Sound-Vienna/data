      "rdf:value": "There are many rubato norms in Die Fledermaus that are unwritten in the score but which are consistently done by Viennese orchestras, one of which occurs in the Allegretto here: after a few fairly 'in-time' repetitions there is a considerable pull-back to end the phrase. Although the extent to which time is taken varies year by year within the VPO (with progressively more time taken over time in general), the feeling of the phrasal movement is consistent throughout, as well as with the Volksoperorchestra and the WJSO under Herbert Siebert. Orchestras outside Vienna sometimes follow in Vienna's footsteps, but at times also treat the section with much more variation. While the London Symphony Orchestra under Mackerras follow the VPO model almost exactly, Kurt Schmid, leading the Philharmonie Lugansk, takes a break that is just slightly longer before the last downbeat, and on the other end of the spectrum, Kendlinger and his K& K Philharmoniker play straight through, hardly taking time at all."
