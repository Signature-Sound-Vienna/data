The longest, which appears in both Krauss recordings in our collection as well as in the Wiener Johann Strauss Orchestra's 2015 recording with conductor Herbert Siebert involves playing straight through until the end of measure 112. There, while in the critical edition score da capo is indicated, here the orchestra first repeats the trio before starting again from the beginning. They likewise ignore that indication at the end of bar 51 to jump to the coda, playing on until the beginning of the trio -- bar 84 -- before jumping to the coda."
