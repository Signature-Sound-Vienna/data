      "rdf:value": "In all critical scores of the Donauwalzer the first flute ascends from an E above the staff at the end of measure 4 to the F-sharp above it on the downbeat of measure 5. This flies in the face of traditional performance practice, where this is so rarely done that following the score has become an outlier descision. In fact, there are no recordings with Viennese orchestras in our corpus where this happens. Instead, the flutes descend to the D one full step below the E. The sole commercial recordings in our collection where the flutes ascend as written are three recordings of the K&K Philharmonie of Tyrol native Matthias Georg Kendlinger, and a recording with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra under Leonard Bernstein from 1982 (presented for comparison alongside the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra's 2017 New Year's rendition)."
