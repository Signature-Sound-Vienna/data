      "rdf:value": "Trains, a theme in eleven Strauss family compositions, can be evoked in various ways, one of which is the sounding of the Kondukteurhorn (conductor's horn), scored solely in the trio. The instrument called for is a simple brass instrument historically worn around the train conductor’s neck or sat next to him on the bench which were sounded to warn of the train’s arrival before the use of signals installed in the trains themselves became widespread. Just as there was likely no standardized form for these signal horns when they were in use, their form varies from a tiny, flared trumpet that resembles a children's toy or party favor (1950s,1970, 1992 2001, Harnoncourt) to a tri-bulbed contraption (2016), or -- in a Deutsche Radio Philharmonie performance in 2021 conducted by Karen Kamensek-- a long flared tube around two feet long painted to resemble a German flag and giving an effect similar to an Alphorn. If no horn is available, sometimes whistles or other noisemakers are also employed in connection with standard brass to create a similar effect (Estonian National Symphony). When employed, they sound distinctively out of tune with the rest of the ensemble. For this reason, they are sometimes avoided entirely in New Years' Concert performances, with only the standard trumpets which double the Kondukteurhorn employed in their stead, sacrificing the works's essential character for a more polished sound (1982, 1987, 2005, Michalski)."
