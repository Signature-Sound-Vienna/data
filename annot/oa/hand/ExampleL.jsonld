      "rdf:value": "Over the years, a gradual broadening of tempo has become evident, particularly in performances by the Vienna Philharmonic, where the characteristic Viennese Schwung increasingly defines the style—even in passages of pronounced martial character. This tendency is especially prominent in recordings such as the 2021 New Year’s Concert conducted by Franz Welser-Möst and the 2008 rendition led by Georges Prêtre. In both, the rhythmic lilt is so accentuated, the percussion so understated, and the inner textures so prominent that the resulting theme evokes the gentle charm of a child’s carousel more than the urgency of a military summons. A comparable effect is found in the Berlin Philharmonic’s 1984 performance, where the legato phrasing of the trumpets renders the theme entirely lyrical, if not innocuous."
